The objective of the notebook is to present the data preparation, explorative data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of classical machine learning and deep learning for predicting football player's transfer market value.\n",

        "The main focus of the project is the comparison of  model performane based on real football statistics. Several individual and team statistics will be used to train the models (including standard, shooting, goalkeeping, passing, defensive actions, and miscallenaoeus stats). The target value is the estimated value of football player (market value).\n",
